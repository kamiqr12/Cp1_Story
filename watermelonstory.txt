I went to the grocery store near my house.
The store was called Jewel-Osco.
At the store, I bought 2 watermelons.
They were very big.
When I got back home, I shared a watermelon with my family.
They all enjoyed the watermelon.
I wrapped up the other watermelon with wrapping paper.
I put the watermelon in a box and wrapped the box.
I mailed the box to Devany.
She was very surprised about her birthday gift.
She liked the watermelon very much.
She ate the watermelon at her party.
It was very juicy.
